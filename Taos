It gives testimony to the culture of Pueblo Indians, that developed around 1400 after the disappearance of the Anasazi tribes in the region.Community Perspective: an entrance fee is levied and many places in town are restricted areas, but most visitors find it an interesting experience. Joining a local tour and the bakery come recommended. Be aware that the pueblo can 'close' on short notice due to a funeral for example.",

Fundamental to the mission of the D. H. Lawrence Ranch Initiatives is preservation of the property and historic buildings.",

The surrounding village maintains an authentic, lived-in quality that you wont find in more touristy spots. Feels like stumbling into the 18th century.",

History buffs and Western enthusiasts will appreciate the context, but casual visitors might find it underwhelming compared to Taoss more visually dramatic attractions.",
