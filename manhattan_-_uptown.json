The Audubon Terrace's remoteness is a big part of its charm. Audubon owned twenty acres of rolling hills, ideal for his naturalistic obsessions, and when he died in 1851, the land was parceled off into a shaded neighborhood named Audubon Park. Philanthropist Archer Milton Huntington developed several institutions here including the Hispanic Society of America and the original Museum of the American Indian.",

    "description": "This captivating public park not only hosts the renowned Cloisters museum, but it's also one of the lushest and most romantic spots in Manhattan, with dramatic outlooks over the Hudson River and sweeping views of the Palisades. Curiously, the name refers to Sir William Tryon (1729–1788), one of the last governors of the Province of New York, who led British forces to burn and plunder civilian outposts throughout New England during the Revolutionary War. He was a debonair monster. And yet the name has, by tradition, stuck. Wander the meandering paths and you'll come across several other mementos of long-ago times, including a bronze plaque to the memory of Margaret Corbin (1751–1800), considered the first woman to see active battle in the Revolutionary War and the first to receive a military pension after the war.",

Featuring two flexible, state-of-the-art black box theaters, gathering spaces, exhibition space, and administrative offices all within what was Lowe's Victoria Theater (designed by architect Thomas Lamb and opened in 1918), The Apollo Stages at the Victoria Theater advances the non-profit organization's mission to support emerging and established artists of color across disciplines, and further solidifies it as an artistic, educational, and civic resource and cultural anchor within the community.<br><br>The two purpose-built theaters have a custom built, retractable seating system to allow for multiple configurations. With a flexible 199-seat and 99-seat capacity, the performance spaces are designed to accommodate both traditional and non-traditional stagings. Several detail portions of the historic Victoria Theater were preserved and have been restored, including its original terra cotta façade, the grand staircase in the ornate entrance lobby, detailed tile floors, and marquee, which have been incorporated into the new design in order to honor its significance in Harlem's history.",

While the fire tower network, which at its peak included 11 towers, fell into disuse in the 1870s, the bell atop the Mount Morris tower continued to sound for timekeeping and churchgoing purposes until about 1909. In 2000, architect and preservationist Angel Ayón, Principal of AYON Studio, began and continued advising stakeholders, including the Mt. Morris Park Community Improvement Association and the Marcus Garvey Park Alliance, in their campaign to save the tower. As a result of their collective advocacy, the tower's rehabilitation was completed by the City.",
