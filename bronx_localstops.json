Except for 11 months between 1775 and 1776, Valentine and his family remained in the house throughout the war. The house, in close proximity to cannons clustered on a nearby hill, miraculously survived several fierce battles. Financial ruin forced Isaac Valentine to sell the home and the 260-acre property to Isaac Varian, a successful butcher and farmer, in 1792. The Varians kept the house for three generations; one of Isaac’s grandsons, also named Isaac, served as New York City’s 63rd mayor, from 1839-1841",
