The Church of the Intercession in the City and Diocese of New York is a house of prayer for all people with many tongues and talents. It is a shining example of 19th Century American Church architecture in the English Gothic Style. As a testament to this fact the building was placed in the National Register of Historic Places. The parish complex was designed by the renowned architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue and he selected this location to be his final resting place because he considered it his finest work. His remains lay in a beautiful mausoleum inside the nave of the church, on the north ambulatory. Entrusted with the care and maintenance of Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue's national Gothic revival landmark building, our church and church family aims to provide members and visitors with a place whose open doors welcome everyone. This architectural marvel is also the home to several community based organizations (including a chapter of the Girl Scouts of America, a community based Sports and Recreation program, The Native American Cultural Museum and Alcoholic Anonymous) and the holiday reading of Twas the Night Before Christmas (A Visit from Saint Nicholas) by Clement Clarke Moore. This event is considered New York's Oldest Christmas tradition. It is also home to the Uptown Brass Quintet â€” a chamber ensemble of five professional brass musiciansâ€”and it is often chosen by filmmakers and photographers alike because of the building's architectural beauty.",

Just up the street from the Audubon Ballroom sits another Thomas Lamb movie palace -- the equally dazzling Loew's 175th Street Theatre, one of New York City's original Wonder Theatres that took movie going to a new level of luxury. It took a decidedly Evangelical direction in 1969 when the television preacher Reverend Ike transformed it into the Palace Cathedral. While it still retains religious ties, the venue is frequently opened to concerts and film revivals -- and frequently hosts tours of the site.",

In 1872, as masses of new arrivals from far-off lands crammed into tenements, an attractive water tower was constructed near the High Bridge to help increase the water pressure into the city. The water has long been turned off, but the bridge still beckons pedestrians onto its expanse over the Harlem.",

    "description": "This diesel train serviced the Brooklyn waterfront for more than three decades. Built on the former site of the New York Central Railroad's 60th Street Yard, Riverside Park South was once the primary import, export and classification area for Manhattan's sole all-freight train line for over a century. At this yard, the New York Central Railroad operated bulk cargo piers and transfer bridges, including the extant 69th Street Transfer Bridge and gantry. Though the rail yard is no longer active, the landscape architecture of Riverside Park South reflects its history, including an authentic locomotive stationed in the park. Visit the newly-renovated train while learning about the rail history of Manhattan's West Side from staff from the Riverside Park Conservancy. One of the unique features of Riverside Park South is a historic train locomotive â€” a literal reminder of the site's history as a former train yard. No. 25 is a 60-year-old, 95-ton engine that most recently labored on the Brooklyn waterfront. Now in its retirement, it is the centerpiece of a plaza at 62nd Street, and a play destination for young and old alike.",

In a city characterized by masonry and brick, the blue-green glass and steel facade reimagined the potential of office buildings and demonstrated that successful office design could prioritize its community. Instead of designating the ground floor for retail, we created a public space. Rather than maximizing rentable floor area, we placed the office floors atop an elevated, horizontal base and set them perpendicular to Park Avenue. This design established a light and airy plaza and introduced a new relationship between the office and public realm.",

Completed in 2023, the nearly half-mile pedestrian esplanade is built over the water, rising above 2100 sea level rise, and links to the larger esplanade system that encircles Manhattan. The design minimizes visual obstruction by utilizing structural interstitial spaces to conceal substantial soil volumes for a robust planting design and to allow large trees to anchor naturally against wind. Stormwater is captured and flows within the structure to passively irrigate plantings selected to withstand the harsh conditions of the location, including salts, winds, and periodic drought.",

The office building that replaced it lacked a connection to the city, didn't accommodate the public, and was failing to provide for its tenants. MdeAS Architects and Vornado Realty Trust envisioned a new building on the site that embodied the most progressive ideals in the workplace typology today. After many studies, it was determined that preserving the existing structure could actually create the best environment while reducing carbon emissions and costs. Today, PENN 2 has been transformed with a new high-performance faÃ§ade, an iconic free-spanning addition called The Bustle, a 288,000-diode LED art installation, 75,000 square feet of new outdoor area, and world class amenities and office space. The tour will go inside The Bustle, onto the terraces, and access exclusive amenities, including the 17,000 sq ft roof park.",
