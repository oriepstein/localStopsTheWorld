The Church of the Intercession in the City and Diocese of New York is a house of prayer for all people with many tongues and talents. It is a shining example of 19th Century American Church architecture in the English Gothic Style. As a testament to this fact the building was placed in the National Register of Historic Places. The parish complex was designed by the renowned architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue and he selected this location to be his final resting place because he considered it his finest work. His remains lay in a beautiful mausoleum inside the nave of the church, on the north ambulatory. Entrusted with the care and maintenance of Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue's national Gothic revival landmark building, our church and church family aims to provide members and visitors with a place whose open doors welcome everyone. This architectural marvel is also the home to several community based organizations (including a chapter of the Girl Scouts of America, a community based Sports and Recreation program, The Native American Cultural Museum and Alcoholic Anonymous) and the holiday reading of Twas the Night Before Christmas (A Visit from Saint Nicholas) by Clement Clarke Moore. This event is considered New York's Oldest Christmas tradition. It is also home to the Uptown Brass Quintet — a chamber ensemble of five professional brass musicians—and it is often chosen by filmmakers and photographers alike because of the building's architectural beauty.",

In 1872, as masses of new arrivals from far-off lands crammed into tenements, an attractive water tower was constructed near the High Bridge to help increase the water pressure into the city.

    "description": "This diesel train serviced the Brooklyn waterfront for more than three decades. Built on the former site of the New York Central Railroad's 60th Street Yard, Riverside Park South was once the primary import, export and classification area for Manhattan's sole all-freight train line for over a century. At this yard, the New York Central Railroad operated bulk cargo piers and transfer bridges, including the extant 69th Street Transfer Bridge and gantry. Though the rail yard is no longer active, the landscape architecture of Riverside Park South reflects its history, including an authentic locomotive stationed in the park. Visit the newly-renovated train while learning about the rail history of Manhattan's West Side from staff from the Riverside Park Conservancy. One of the unique features of Riverside Park South is a historic train locomotive — a literal reminder of the site's history as a former train yard. No. 25 is a 60-year-old, 95-ton engine that most recently labored on the Brooklyn waterfront. Now in its retirement, it is the centerpiece of a plaza at 62nd Street, and a play destination for young and old alike.",

In a city characterized by masonry and brick, the blue-green glass and steel facade reimagined the potential of office buildings and demonstrated that successful office design could prioritize its community. Instead of designating the ground floor for retail, we created a public space. Rather than maximizing rentable floor area, we placed the office floors atop an elevated, horizontal base and set them perpendicular to Park Avenue. This design established a light and airy plaza and introduced a new relationship between the office and public realm.",

Completed in 2023, the nearly half-mile pedestrian esplanade is built over the water, rising above 2100 sea level rise, and links to the larger esplanade system that encircles Manhattan. The design minimizes visual obstruction by utilizing structural interstitial spaces to conceal substantial soil volumes for a robust planting design and to allow large trees to anchor naturally against wind. Stormwater is captured and flows within the structure to passively irrigate plantings selected to withstand the harsh conditions of the location, including salts, winds, and periodic drought.",

The office building that replaced it lacked a connection to the city, didn't accommodate the public, and was failing to provide for its tenants. MdeAS Architects and Vornado Realty Trust envisioned a new building on the site that embodied the most progressive ideals in the workplace typology today. After many studies, it was determined that preserving the existing structure could actually create the best environment while reducing carbon emissions and costs. Today, PENN 2 has been transformed with a new high-performance façade, an iconic free-spanning addition called The Bustle, a 288,000-diode LED art installation, 75,000 square feet of new outdoor area, and world class amenities and office space. The tour will go inside The Bustle, onto the terraces, and access exclusive amenities, including the 17,000 sq ft roof park.",

    "description": "MOST VISITORS TO BOWLING GREEN today come to see Arturo Di Modica's imposing Charging Bull sculpture. But unnoticed in the background of their photographs is one of New York Cities most enduring and historically important landmarks: its oldest fence. Made of wrought iron, the historic barrier was installed around Bowling Green in 1771. The history of Bowling Green itself goes back to the beginnings of the New Amsterdam colony. Situated across from the original Dutch fort it was originally used as a cattle market and parade ground, it was located at the foot of the old American Indian path which would eventually become Broadway. On March 12th, 1733 the market place was leased to three gentleman landowners for a sum of one peppercorn a year, and the ground was turned into New York's first public park. Named Bowling Green for the sporting arena that it contained, it was designed for the \"beauty and ornament...as well as for the Recreation and Delight of the inhabitants of this city.\" But the idyllic tranquility of Bowling Green would turn to mob violence in 1776. Six years earlier the British government had installed a giant statue of King George III. Weighing over 4,000 pounds it was built to celebrate the victory over the French in the Seven Years War. As relations between Britain and her colonies steadily deteriorated the statue became a focal point for anti-English protests. To combat the increasing threat of vandalism a wrought iron fence was installed to protect the monarch in 1771. On July 9th, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read out to Washington's troops stationed by City Hall. A mob from the Sons of Liberty rushed to Bowling Green and immediately attacked and toppled the statue of George III. Legend has it that the statue was shipped up to a foundry in Connecticut where the likeness of George III was turned into musket balls to be used against his red-coated army. Partial remains of the statue can still be found in the Museum of the City of New York.<br><br>Today Bowling Green still holds its place in history as the first public park in the City. Where once King George III looked up towards Broadway as his subjects played the gentle game of Crown Bowls in the park, there is now a fountain. Surrounded by the imposing buildings of the Alexander Hamilton customs house, the old Standard Oil headquarters and the shipping offices of Cunard and the Panama-Pacific Ocean liners, it's a popular spot for tourists. New York's oldest fence which once protected a king is still there though, and on closer inspection still bears the scars of that day of violence in 1776. See the fence posts were once decorated with royal crowns but on July 9th, the Sons of Liberty cut them off and the saw marks are still visible today.",

    "description": "NOW AN ANONYMOUS CONDOMINIUM, THE building stands on a site of one of the financial building blocks of New York City, and one of its greatest shames: the sale and trade of enslaved people. <br><br>In 1626, 11 captives from Congo, Angola, and the island of Sao Tome were brought to New Amsterdam. Over the next 150 years, the New York slave trade grew to be one of the most essential cogs in the triangle trade. Seventy-four Wall Street, on the lot bounded by Water and Pearl Streets, is the most widely accepted address of this auction block.<br><br>The first enslaved workers who were brought to the site were tasked with constructing defenses for the small Dutch colony in the form of a wall across the town's northern frontier. Years later, the wall would be taken down and its fragments used to level the roads and expand the island as landfill. All of the requisite labor was done by enslaved people.<br><br>At the start of the 18th century, the corner of Wall and Pearl Street was an open-air market, where enslaved people were unloaded from ships in the nearby East River. At that time, the river was much closer at Water Street, which meant that the enslaved people were bought and sold right under the shadow of their floating prisons. Later development brought a sheltered complex, city oversight and, of course, tax revenue. Enslaved people were sold throughout the city and its surrounding region. In a wider scope, New York positioned itself as the port city where agricultural goods grown by slaves in the South were financed, refined, packaged and shipped around the world. The New York Stock Exchange, just up the street, owes its startup capital to an economy fueled by enslaved people and their labor.<br><br>Today, no evidence remains of the New York Slave Market. In June of 2015, the City of New York unveiled a small plaque in the beer garden adjacent to the modern day 74 Wall Street. <br><br>The small plaque memorializing the many thousands of enslaved people who were abducted and sold on what is now 74 Wall Street is roughly the size of a plaque across the street at 74 Wall Street honoring the Livingston family, who owed their political prominence to the wealth they generated from the slave trade. <br><br>The United States currently has no significant national memorial to slavery.",

    "description": "This Wall Street bar was once a hub of revolutionary activity where Washington famously bid farewell to his troops. Fraunces Tavern holds the top spot on the list of Manhattan's oldest buildings. The tavern was also one of the first buildings to be designated a New York City Landmark in 1965, though much of the original colonial structure is non-existent. There has been a structure located at the site since 1719 when it was originally built as a private residence for Etienne DeLancey. In 1761 Samuel Fraunces, from whom the building takes its name, bought the building and opened the Queens Head Tavern. The tavern played a significant role in the American Revolution, serving as a meeting place for revolutionary groups like the Sons of Liberty and as a residence for George Washington during the final days of the war. However, after a restoration in 1906, much of the original structure was lost or obscured and there was a lot of guesswork in recreating the original structure. There are however some pieces of the original structure that survive. On the west wall of the tavern, there is 18th century Holland Brick and inside there are original oak hewn beams in the floors and ceilings of some of the upper rooms, including the famous Long Room.",

    "description": "Once the tallest building in the world and the site of \"the highest dinner ever held in New York\" this building now holds the most expensive penthouse in the city.When the Woolworth Building opened in 1913, President Woodrow Wilson pressed a button in the White House, and 80,000 light bulbs flashed to life on Broadway as Thomas Edison supervised. Then Edison joined a banquet for 900 other prominent guests that the New-York Tribune called \"the highest dinner ever held in New York.\" During the ceremonies, famed radio pastor Samuel Parkes Cadman made \"cathedral of commerce\" the skyscraper's nickname for the ages.<br><br>Over 100 years later, much of the original glory remains, though the general public wouldn't know it. Master architect Cass Gilbert's Gothic gem still gleams in lower Manhattan, but few tourists have been inside in recent years. The building's owners for the past couple of decades closed it to casual visitors. Post-9/11 security restrictions didn't help, either. But that's starting to change.<br><br>Thanks to the efforts of Gilbert's great-granddaughter, Helen Post-Curry, the owners allowed private tours in 2013 for the building's centennial celebration. A great response led to regular paid tours. The tours focus almost entirely on the lobby—in addition to the aforementioned unfortunate closures, the 57th-floor observation deck was shut down during World War II out of fear that enemy spies could exploit its harbor views—but the lobby contains plenty to illuminate the Woolworth's soaring story. One need only look up at the grand Heinigke & Bowen stained-glass ceiling over the main stairs to grasp F.W. Woolworth's animating vision. Border panels devoted to great empire-builders like Spain and Russia lie alongside others featuring the Woolworth \"W\" as well as 1913 for the building opening and 1879 for the opening of the first successful \"Woolworth's Great Five Cent Store\" in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (a store in Utica, New York, failed in 1878, and Woolworth reused its sign in Lancaster). By 1910, the operation was humming along well enough for Woolworth to lay plans for a company headquarters that would be the tallest building in the world, surpassing the 700-foot Metropolitan Life Insurance skyscraper completed in 1909. Woolworth scrapped a more modest $5 million estimate, and the final bill of $13.5 million produced the 792-foot (and one inch) finished structure of 58 stories (or 80 conventional stories, since ceilings range from 11 to 20 feet). The retail baron paid for it all in cash—perhaps in nickels and dimes only, as some say, and perhaps not.<br><br>It's also said that Woolworth spared no expense on the construction. Yet despite the gaudy price tag, he couldn't resist a bit of skimping (amusingly enough, Woolworth is counting coins in the lobby gargoyle that portrays him). The Tiffany elevator ornamentation is cast iron done up like brass, terra cotta masquerades as marble on the exterior, and interior marble touted as \"Greek\" was actually mined in Vermont. Woolworth hired Cass Gilbert to create a world-class, historic company monument, but he always had business in mind.<br><br>\"My idea was purely commercial,\" he said in 1910. \"I saw possibilities of making this the greatest income producing property in which I could invest my money.\"<br><br>The building's construction was a media phenomenon, and Woolworth was surely pleased with its critical reception and popularity. Woolworth opened his crown jewel up just like his stores, with counters and eateries alongside plentiful retail outlets. Missteps were minimal, such as the German beer hall shunned by some patriots during World War I, though the war's drain on construction did benefit the building overall—it remained the world's tallest until 1930, when the Chrysler Building and then the Empire State Building were completed.<br><br>The Woolworth Building finally left Woolworth hands in 1998 with a $155 million sale to the Witkoff Group, which launched a plan to turn the top 25 floors of the building into luxury condominiums.",

    "description": "An odd, ancient window that may have once been part of a brutal prison is embedded in the side of New York's Police Plaza. <br>HIDDEN AWAY ON A WALL of the New York City Police Department Headquarters is a mysterious window. Embedded in the wall, and made of an ancient brick which doesn't match the ones surrounding it, the window is set with a row of ominous, rusted iron bars. It is thought that this is the remnants of a horrendous prison dating back to the Revolutionary War that stood on the same site. The infamously brutal, Sugar House Prison.<br><br>The plaque underneath the iron-barred window explains that \"this window was originally part of the five-story Sugar House built in 1763 at the corner of Duane and Rose Streets.\" During the occupation of New York (1776-1783) by the English, the Sugar House was commandeered by the Redcoats and repurposed as a prison for American prisoners of war, and civilian collaborators. <br><br>As the website Correction History writes, the Sugar House Prison was operated as a place where \"sanitary conditions were frightful, and starvation was a constant threat, so its evil reputation was well earned, and its death toll unbelievably high.\" It is estimated that over 17,500 prisoners died in these conditions, more than twice the number to actually die on the battlefield. <br><br>Sugar houses proved ideal prisons for the British. Another on Liberty Street held around 500 wretched prisoners. An article in the New York Times in 1852 included a first-person account of conditions within the sugar houses by an ex-inmate. \"Its appearance was dark and gloomy.....prisoners in an emaciated, starving, wretched condition, their numbers being constantly diminished by sickness and death.\" <br><br>There is however some doubt as to the origins of the peculiar window preserved in the wall on Duane Street. As reported in Untapped Cities in 2013, recent research by Professor Edwin G. Burrows at Brooklyn College, claimed that the sugar house on Duane and Rose continued to operate during the occupation.<br><br>What is interesting though is that when the old Sugar House was demolished in 1892, someone had the foresight to preserve a window which undoubtedly looks prison like, and it was incorporated into the wall of the new Rhinelander building. When that too was demolished in 1968 to make way for the present day NYPD headquarters the old window was again preserved in the wall of the brutalist architecture of Police Plaza<br><br>Peculiarly enough, a section of the wall from the ancient sugar house, with an identical window embedded in it, found its way to Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. If the origins of the strange window hidden away on the wall of the NYPD building are debatable, what is beyond doubt is the horrific conditions of the British Sugar House prisons, and the thousands of revolutionaries who died there, many of whom are rumored to haunt the memorial still.",

    "description": "An uber-secure, windowless tower of doom in the center of Manhattan is an NSA spyscraper. <br>SO YOU FINALLY NOTICED THAT terrifying, windowless skyscraper in the middle of Manhattan? It's fine, really. Now, move along.<br><br>Unofficially known as the \"Long Lines Building,\" New York's doom-iest tower was designed in 1974 by architect John Carl Warneke. Though its most noteworthy feature is its utter lack of windows, the building is also known for its unusually high ceilings and for being designed to bear an extremely large amount of weight per square-foot. <br><br>Not that the latter two details are something the average citizen would ever be privy to witnessing on their own, of course. The name \"Long Lines\" suggests a lovely hat tip to the building's architectural elements, but in reality the sky fortress was originally created to house AT&T's carrier exchanges for their long distance telephone switches and equipment. Today it continues in that purpose, while also storing a portion of the company's datacenter processing. This ephemeral element of the technological infrastructure has been deemed so important that the building is able to survive nuclear fallout and exist off-grid for up to two weeks without issue.<br><br>What's more, it's since come to light that this ominous building is used as a hub for NSA spying—a brick-and-mortar arm of the surveillance state. As reported by The Intercept, the fortified skyscraper was not only made to safeguard critical telecommunications equipment, a sort of fortress for the information age, but it also houses equipment for controversial government data collection and wire tapping, codenamed TITANPOINTE.<br><br>One look at the skyscraper's face should tell you that public admittance isn't an option. But that beautiful, terrifying image you have in your head of stories upon stories of telephone cables and digital boxes stacked 18-feet high, glowing within the building's impenetrable walls, might just be better than the real thing, anyway",

    "description": "The façade of this building looks like a bingo board, but it's really a giant clock by a famed graphic designer. <br>RUDOLPH DE HARAK WAS A famous graphic designer who worked on a lot of things over his long and storied career: hundreds of paperbook covers for McGraw-Hill, illustrations for Esquire magazine, jazz covers for record labels like Columbia and Westminster. He even designed the placards for the Egyptian Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, signage that took 10 years to complete and is still in use today. But for many New Yorkers, perhaps his most famous and enduring work is the clock on the exterior of 127 John Street in Lower Manhattan.<br><br>The artist was influenced by abstract expressionism, Dada, op art, and pop art. He even designed a number of \"traditional\" analog clocks, some of which can be found in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. But the façade across from the South Street Seaport takes a more digital approach. The clock is laid out as a grid of numbers: 1–12 for the hour of the day, then 0-59 for the minute and the second. The numbers light up whenever it is their time; the hours in red, the minutes in blue, and the seconds in green.<br><br>At the time work was completed in 1971, it was the largest clock in the world. The clock is joined by a number of embellishments to the building and street. The entrance of the building is a tunnel ringed in bright blue argon-gas lights, and the building is surrounded by brightly colored street furniture like loveseats, garbage cans, and telephone booths.",

    "description": "The last remnants of what was once one of the world's grandest hotels can now be found in a Manhattan subway station. THE FULTON STREET STATION ON New York's subway system recently benefitted from a 10-year, $1.4 billion overhaul. The centre piece of the MTA's \"Grand Central of Downtown,\" which re-opened in November of 2014, was an elaborate \"oculus\" dome of glass and aluminium, spanning 53-feet in diameter, representing what the MTA grandly called \"a metaphor for the celestial heaven.\"<br><br>As impressive as the giant skylight is, there was quite a remarkable spectacle already in place at Fulton Street Station, hidden away and largely unnoticed at the William Street entrance; the beautiful tile murals that once adorned the walls of the Marine Grill, a grand restaurant located in what was once the world's largest hotel, the McAlpin.<br><br>The Hotel McAlpin was situated in Herald Square, occupying the corner block of 34th Street and Broadway. Opening in 1912 and soaring 25-stories high, the McAlpin had room enough for 2,500 guests. As well as being, at the time, the world's largest hotel, it was also one of the most luxurious. The amenities on offer to guests were as breathtaking as they were opulent, including a massive giant Turkish bath and plunge pool that occupied the entire 24th floor. The hotel also had its own in-house orchestra, as well as its own fully equipped hospital. Located on the floor below the Turkish bath, patients benefitted from \"every modern appliance known to surgery.\" <br><br>The hotel even had gender specific floors, with newspaper adverts promising that \"for unaccompanied women, the entire sixth floor is reserved.\" There was even a separate check-in desk staffed by women, so that single female travelers could avoid the approaches of scoundrels in the main lobby. <br><br>Such was the attention given to customer service that the entire 16th floor was reserved for night workers so they could sleep during the day; the New York Times christened the floor the \"Sleepy Sixteenth.\"<br><br>These heights of luxury extended to the Marine Grill restaurant located in the basement. Dominated by a forest of archways and columns, the grill room was covered in exquisite tile murals designed by Frederick Dana Marsh. The tiles told the story of the maritime history of New York, and featured elaborate murals of steamships, paddle steamers, and ocean liners from the golden age of Trans-Atlantic voyages.<br><br>The 20 murals, fabricated by the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company of Staten Island, spoke to the era when New York was one of the world's most vibrant, and busiest ports. Covering the entire wall space, they would have looked down on a packed room of patrons dining on lobster and oysters, washed down with Gibson cocktails. <br><br>In the 1970s, the grand McAlpin was sold and converted into 700 apartments, which still exist today, under the name Herald Towers. During renovations, the glorious tile murals were simply thrown away. Susan Tunick, president of the non-profit Friends of Terra Cotta, alerted the New York Landmarks Preservation Committee and the tiles were rescued from the dumpsters outside the old hotel. The tiles were then given to the MTA's Arts for Transit Program, and they were reassembled piece by piece like a giant jigsaw puzzle over one summer by a group of college interns. In 2000 the restored murals were installed in the Fulton Street Station, along with the ornate iron gate that had adorned the entrance to the Marine Grill. <br><br>New York may have lost one of its grand old hotels, but subway passengers entering Fulton Street Station by the Williams Street entrance can see a little known remnant of its once luxurious opulence.",

The collection includes a still working clock given to Embury and Heck by John Wesley himself in 1768.

The American Merchant Mariner's memorial, sculpted by Marisol Escobar in 1991, takes the form of three merchant seamen stranded on a sinking ship, terrified, calling for help and trying to reach the desperate hand of one of their shipmates floundering in the water below.<br><br>The United States Merchant Mariner suffered more casualties than any other American service during World War II, 1 of every 26 mariners would not return home. Facing submarines, mines, armed raiders, destroyers, aircraft, \"kamikaze,\" and the elements. About 8,300 mariners were killed at sea, 12,000 wounded of whom at least 1,100 died from their wounds, and 663 men and women were taken prisoner. Some were blown to death, some incinerated, some drowned, some froze, and some starved. Sixty-six died in prison camps or aboard Japanese ships while being transported to other camps. Thirty-one American merchant ships vanished without a trace to a watery grave.<br><br>The sculpture bears the following inscription: \"This memorial serves as a marker for America's merchant mariners resting in the unmarked ocean depths.\" The monument is based on a true event, the sinking of SS Muskogee by German U-boat 123 on March 22nd, 1942. The Muskogee was sailing from Venezuela to Halifax carrying a cargo of petroleum. Without an escort and unarmed, the Muskogee was hit by a torpedo in her engine room and began to sink within a quarter of an hour, 335 miles north-northeast. Ten survivors clung to life rafts in the burning sea as the U-boat surfaced. The submarine captain Reinhard Hardegen took their photograph, and it's from this, that Escobar based her sculpture. <br><br>What makes the memorial so moving is that the helpless sailor in the water is covered by the Upper New York Bay with each high tide. His fingertips permanently out of reach to his companions, he drowns twice a day. The plaque next to the memorial makes the striking statue all the more poignant, where we learn that for the crew of the SS Muskogee; \"left to the perils of the sea, the survivors later perished.\"",

Built in 1766, St. Paul's was one of two chapels built for Trinity Church, the second being St. George's which burned down. St. Paul's almost met a similar fate in the Great Fire of 1777 which destroyed around 500 buildings, but luckily it was saved. The original Trinity Church was lost in that fire, so St. Paul's became the congregation's primary church.<br><br>George Washington regularly attended services at St. Paul's until Trinity Church was rebuilt in 1790. In fact, he went to St. Paul's right after his inauguration at Federal Hall, just a short walk away, in 1789. He sat in a specially designated Presidential Pew. While the pew is no longer there, a painting of the one of the earliest known representations of the Great Seal of the United States, commissioned in 1789 to commemorate Washington's inauguration still hangs above the site where he would have sat.<br><br>The church is full of original architectural details and a very special monument to General Richard Montgomery. Montgomery was a Revolutionary War officer and the monument to him at St. Paul's was the first commissioned by the Congress of the United States.\"<br><br>This cemetery has graves dating back to the 17th century, including the city's oldest carved tombstone and an ominous cryptogram.",

    "description": "On buzzing Wall Street, in what was once the main entrance lobby of a thirty-seven-story skyscraper, Aesop occupies a space of preserved Art-Deco grandeur. Designed with trusted collaborator Jakob Sprenger, the intention was to create something that feels like it might have always been there. Inspiration for this chic retail space came from the bold verticality of Manhattan and the building's history as the office of the Munson Steamship Line in the 1920s. <br><br>The magnificent pre-existing space was defined by soaring ceilings and walls clad in Fior di Pesco marble. Based on the classical Greek order, pilasters added rhythm to the walls while ornate crown moldings and a coffered ceiling gave the room a strong, opulent character. Developed with Aesop's in-house team, Sprenger's concept was to maintain the existing architectural splendor, restore integrity where needed, and to insert a layer of free-standing furniture that could be easily reused in a future location. <br><br>In the depths of the store, a petit chamber in soothing dark hues accommodates more intimate explorations of the brand's unconventional Eaux de Parfum, leaving the hubbub of Wall Street behind. Each fragrance can be sampled at the horizontal bay, where petri dishes containing fragments of scent-imbued muslin cloth allow one to understand the full body of the aroma.",

Gotham Park is transforming that space into a neighborhood nexus connecting and strengthening residents, businesses, and communities.<br><br>Built upon the spirit of the original Brooklyn Banks skate mecca, Gotham Park will restore the Banks while expanding public space and access to create a variety of flexible play spaces that inspire, engage and delight all ages. Woven together from the vaults, arches, and land beneath the Brooklyn Bridge, Gotham Park is building a hyper-urban, iconic public space for its communities, by its communities.",
