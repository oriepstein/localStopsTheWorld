    "description": "The lesser-known Alice sculpture of Central Park dedicated to the godmother of American children. <br>THE ALICE IN WONDERLAND SCULPTURE by José de Creeft is one of the most popular public artworks in Central Park, perennially surrounded by children and selfie-seeking tourists. What many of them don't know is that only a short walk away stands another, older monument inspired by the curious fantasy world of Lewis Carroll.<br><br>Smack in the middle of a run-of-the-mill playground facing Fifth Avenue, the Sophie Loeb Fountain was commissioned by philanthropist August Heckscher in 1936 to honor his longtime friend, the social-welfare advocate Sophie Irene Loeb, the "godmother of American children" who died seven years prior. Together, they once campaigned for the addition of children's playgrounds to Central Park.<br><br>Created by American sculptor Frederick Roth, the white granite fountain features 13 characters from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, including the famous Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit, and the Cheshire Cat. Avid readers of Carroll's books may also recognize the Duchess, the Gryphon, the Frog Footman, and Father William, who is seen balancing an eel on his nose. Alice herself is depicted with a flamingo croquet mallet in her arms, looking slightly older than her literary self.<br><br>Originally installed in Heckscher Playground as a drinking fountain, the memorial was relocated to the Levin Playground in 1986, where the Central Park Conservancy adapted it into a water play feature. Though the figure of Loeb herself is not directly represented, her name is on the pedestal of the fountain. Inscriptions such as "In the depths of despair may I never lose hope" honor her dedication to social justice and the "home for every child" that she created.<br>An Alice in Wonderland-themed sculpture for a woman dedicated to children.",

    "description": "This whimsical group of statues is a favorite of children who love to climb all over Lewis Carroll's beloved characters.  <br>AMIDST THE BUSTLE OF NEW York City in the heart of Central Park is a celebration of a beloved children's classic—Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.<br><br>The group of bronze statues was commissioned by local philanthropist George Delacorte in honor of his wife, Margarita, who used to read the book and Carroll's other works to their children. They were designed by sculptor Jose de Creeft and brought to the life at the Modern Art Foundry in Queens.<br><br>The heroine of the book Alice is seated atop a giant mushroom and the statue is thought to be a likeness of the designer's daughter Donna. The book's other characters like the White Rabbit, the Dormouse, and the Cheshire Cat are all placed around Alice. The statue of the Mad Hatter is supposed to be a caricature of George Delacorte himself.<br><br>Since the monument was dedicated in May 1959, it has been a favorite of children visiting the park, who enjoy scrambling all over the statues, which were designed with this express purpose in mind. Margarita Delacorte's favorite Lewis Carroll poem The Jabberwocky is engraved around the statue, along with other poetic bits from the book, all referencing nursery rhymes and childhood songs of the time. The one engraved text modern audiences can most easily recognize is Twinkle Twinkle Little Bat—its source material still sung by kids today.",

    "description": "Hidden in Central Park's Ramble is a troublesome cave buried just beneath the surface. <br>IN NEW YORK CITY'S CENTRAL Park, just below the 79th St. Traverse, lies a heavily wooded area, interwoven with narrow, winding trails, and dotted with large granite boulders.<br><br>While The Ramble, as it's known, may appear to be the most natural place in the city it only appears that way thanks to the efforts of Central Park's planners Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, as well as the original builders of the Park who put in countless hours constructing a landscape that would seem rustic and remote. But for all their hard work, Central Park has changed. Like everything else in New York City the Park is constantly evolving, but if you know just where to look you can still find traces of its original features. One of the more interesting cases is that of the long-lost Ramble Cave.<br><br>The Ramble Cave was not part of Olmsted and Vaux's 'Greensward Plan', their design for what would become Central Park. They did lay out the Ramble, complete with paths and trees, but to construct their artificial wilderness required a lot of construction and excavation. It was during one such dig that a large deposit of "rich mould" was found in a small bay on the north side of The Lake ('mould' in this case being extremely fertile soil, not what you find on bread that's been sitting on your counter for too long). The mould was carried away, cart-full by cart-full, revealing a narrow cavity, at water level on the lake-side and sloping uphill thirty feet or so to the north, meeting up with a planned path just to the east of the Ramble Arch.<br><br>While the cavity was certainly an interesting find, it didn't quite fit the look that Olmsted and Vaux were going for, nor was it easily accessible from the elevated lake-side trails. To solve the first problem, several large rocks were set on top of the eastern wall with more stones set into the hill beside the north exit, giving the impression that they had slid down naturally.<br><br>As for accessibility, at the southern exit, by the Lake, rough stones were laid out to form a narrow staircase leading from the lake-side path down into the cave, with a border of larger stones hiding the stairs from view except from above. <br><br>The cave was a popular attraction in the Park, with one early guidebook calling it "a great attraction to boys and girls, and hardly less to many children of a larger growth." Later in its life it would become known as the 'Indian Cave', supposedly because the floor showed evidence of early Native American inhabitants, though evidence of this is hard to find. Early sources refer to it simply as "the cave" or "the Ramble Cave".<br><br>Sadly, it was also a popular spot for trouble. In 1904 a man was found near the steps, shot in the chest, supposedly the victim of a suicide attempt (the man, Samuel L. Dana, would recover, but the incident and its mysterious aftermath would set off a media frenzy). In October, 1929 the Times reported that 335 men had been arrested in the Park just that year for what they generously termed "annoying women", with the Ramble Cave held out as a particularly popular spot. Sometime in the 1930s the Cave was sealed off. The entrance by the lake was simply bricked up while the opening by the Ramble Arch was more elaborately sealed and covered over with dirt to make it appear as just another hillside in the Ramble.<br><br>The steps by the Lake are still there however. Unless you know of their existence they, and the Cave, they are the easiest things in the world to walk past, blissfully unaware of this once lovely feature of a young Central Park.The Ramble Cave, also known as the Indian Cave, was created from a natural cave discovered during park construction and used by lake rowers who could leave their boats to explore the area. Unfortunately, in the early 1900s, the cave was the site of several crimes and at least one suicide. In 1929 The New York Times reported that 335 men had been arrested for "a",
