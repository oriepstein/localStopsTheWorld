The Castle is one of the finest surviving examples in New York City of the Gothic Revival castellated style architecture. This architectural style was developed in Great Britain in the mid-1700s and brought to the US in the early 1800s. The popularity of the Gothic Revival style marked a turning away from earlier classical styles based on the buildings of ancient Greece and Rome. In 1982, when the Army considered relinquishing parts of Fort Totten, then-Senator Frank Padavan, a retired US Army Corps of Engineer Officer who had served as Chief of Staff at Fort Totten, assisted the Bayside Historical Society (BHS) in leasing and beginning restoration of the building in 1984. The BHS has been caring for the Castle ever since.",

The church doesn’t have many right angles on the outside; instead its lines curve and arch in exaggerated fashion, lending the church a whimsical, futuristic feel. Completing the futuristic motif is the structure’s roof, which is composed of metallic silver tiles.",

The inventory goes far beyond seating, though: The two-story space has vases, couches, coffee tables, consoles, and photography prints. And Scott says the “inspiring” way Eckstein stages it all — for example, “sitting the colorful pieces that pop against worn, weathered woods that prevent it from feeling as kitschy, or ’90s-dorm-room-esque, as other stores” — has influenced his own apartment’s design. Plus the variety, Scott says, is just plain fun: He once spotted, in a single corner, a pattered grasshopper chair on a cowskin rug beside a white sofa with pink pillows. Jill Singer, editor of online design magazine Sight Unseen, who lives nearby, was struck on her first visit by the “entire vintage car in the showroom” (a BMW Isetta, situated between Snaka Waka sculptures).",
