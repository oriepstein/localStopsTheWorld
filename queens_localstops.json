    "description": "Completed in 1887, The Castle at Fort Totten served as the Base Officers' Mess Hall and Club for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers School of Application. The Castle is one of the finest surviving examples in New York City of the Gothic Revival castellated style architecture. This architectural style was developed in Great Britain in the mid-1700s and brought to the US in the early 1800s. The popularity of the Gothic Revival style marked a turning away from earlier classical styles based on the buildings of ancient Greece and Rome. In 1982, when the Army considered relinquishing parts of Fort Totten, then-Senator Frank Padavan, a retired US Army Corps of Engineer Officer who had served as Chief of Staff at Fort Totten, assisted the Bayside Historical Society (BHS) in leasing and beginning restoration of the building in 1984. The BHS has been caring for the Castle ever since.",

At that point, Underpenny owner and curator Sung Park will tell you that the piece you had your eye on—a sturdy black trivet, a horse-and-carriage toy, an ornate penny bank—is not for sale. The meticulously arranged display, which also includes a collection of hand planes, is the result of more than 15 years of collecting and represents only a portion of Park's total treasure trove.",
