In September 2024, The Bushwick Starr unveiled our new 5,000 sq ft theater—a fully accessible LEED-certified state of the art facility and permanent cultural space for our community, designed by award-winning architectural firm Bureau V Architecture (the studio behind the design of Brooklyn's non-profit music venue National Sawdust). At the new Starr, audiences will enjoy an expanded venue with improved access and comfort, while artists will benefit from larger, functional spaces on-site that support all the ways they work.<br><br>The new lobby brings the Starr's mission to the streets of Brooklyn by welcoming passersby to freely enter throughout the day to an accessible space of community gathering. This space offers a new model for what a lobby space can be: a classroom, screening room, lively gathering space, quiet meeting space—a place where people always feel welcome to meet, mix, connect, and get inspired. Building tours with The Bushwick Starr Co-Founders, Noel Allain and Sue Kessler will be offered on a rolling basis.",

The wheel or rose window was given by the children of the Sunday school at the time of the rebuilding in 1890. It is 28 feet in diameter and is one of the larger windows of this type in Brooklyn. In 1981 the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Church of St. Luke and St. Matthew as a landmark.<br><br>Funded through a NYCDEP Green Infrastructure Grant, the new green infrastructure network for the Church captures, stores, and recycles on-site stormwater to protect the foundation of the historic building from flooding, while sustaining new public gardens and walkways.\"",

The Garden would feature dancers, fireworks, music, and more. As a prominent New Yorker, Niblo purchased and built his mausoleum at Green-Wood well before his earthly demise in 1878. Recognizing its potential as an event space, he would throw wild parties on the lawn of the mausoleum, much to the chagrin of the cemetery management at the time. Today, Green-Wood has embraced Niblo\u2019s legacy and thrown their own parties inspired by Niblo\u2019s Garden.",

Though the Egyptian influence was a big part of Art Deco design in the early 1900s, the Van Ness Parsons mausoleum is a fascinating hybrid of Egyptian Revival and Christian symbolism. Greeting you at the front of the pyramid, you\u2019ll see Jesus Christ, holding a lamb, and the Virgin Mary, holding the infant version of Jesus just next to him. There\u2019s another female figure to the left, probably Pharaoh\u2019s wife discovering baby Moses. But just adjacent to Mary is a friendly sphinx, and there are Egyptian vulture wings that adorn the mausoleum\u2019s doorframe. It\u2019s a beautifully bizarre convergence of cultures.<br><br>The mausoleum belongs to Alfred Ross Parsons, a celebrated pianist and music teacher who died in 1933. Parsons was also an Egyptologist and author of New Light from the Great Pyramid, on the geographical discoveries of the Egyptians. So it\u2019s unsurprising that Parsons rests in a literal pyramid, alongside his wife, Alice Schuyler Van Ness, who predeceased him in 1931.",

Charlotte was thrown from the carriage and died in her father\u2019s arms. She had been hard at work on designs for the tomb of her aunt, who had recently died. Those designs went into her own grave as Charlotte\u2019s grieving father immediately began plans for an elaborate memorial to his daughter at Green-Wood.<br><br>The resulting tomb became one of Green-Wood\u2019s most popular tourist attractions once it was completed in 1848. By the 1860s, people knew \u201cMiss Canda\u201d from poems and songs about her grave at Green-Wood. The gorgeous, Gothic style memorial is filled with symbolism: it is seventeen feet wide and seventeen feet long, for each year of Charlotte\u2019s brief life. A statue of Charlotte stands underneath a canopy of stars, decorated with roses, which symbolize the loss of a young woman. Charlotte\u2019s fiance, a young man named Charles Albert Jarrett de la Marie, consumed with grief, committed suicide a year after her death. At the time, suicides weren\u2019t allowed to be buried in consecrated ground, so he rests just adjacent to Charlotte\u2019s epic memorial at Green-Wood.",

Central to this plan was the construction of a Park Pavilion and Maintenance Facility, designed by 1100 Architect. The concept was developed based on the requirement that five distinct programs (athletic storage, public restroom, staff office, work area, and vehicle storage) be located within one site.<br><br>One of the design challenges was to build a single facility that worked both as a hospitable environment for park visitors, but also as a durable facility for the heavy use of park vehicles and maintenance equipment. To cohesively serve those two very different user groups, the design creates an innovative footprint that merges three connected wings. The building doubles as a gateway to the park, providing a sense of arrival. On track for LEED Silver Certification, the design also includes an array of measures for sustainability and energy efficiency.",
