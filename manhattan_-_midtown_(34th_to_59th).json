    "description": "Commercial office design was forever changed with the completion of SOM\u2019s Lever House in 1952 as the first International Style building in the United States. In a city characterized by masonry and brick, the blue-green glass and steel facade reimagined the potential of office buildings and demonstrated that successful office design could prioritize its community. Instead of designating the ground floor for retail, we created a public space. Rather than maximizing rentable floor area, we placed the office floors atop an elevated, horizontal base and set them perpendicular to Park Avenue. This design established a light and airy plaza and introduced a new relationship between the office and public realm.<br><br>Since then, the landmark has been under the care of SOM for more than 70 years, a level of stewardship that is rare in the architectural profession. SOM restored its facade in 2001, and returned again in 2023 to complete the building\u2019s restoration for the 21st century. Join Principal Frank Mahan of a tour of the completely updated plaza and outdoor spaces, a lovingly restored lobby, and new mechanical systems that improve energy efficiency; and witness how the project has recaptured this midcentury icon\u2019s original splendor as Park Avenue\u2019s premier boutique office.",
