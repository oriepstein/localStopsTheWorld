If the tide is high, you may feel a gentle rocking motion on the walkway as it advances through the tidal marsh, where long-legged white egrets fish for their dinner and diamondback terrapins sun themselves. Benches provide the perfect perch to scan for birds, all against the backdrop of the Manhattan skyline. Stay for the sunset, and investigate the other three miles of easy walking paths.",
