    "description": "When Morris and Sam Schmalberg entered the flower business in 1916, the New York City Garment District produced most women's and children's fashion apparel in the United States. By the 1940s, dozens of flower guys were manufacturing fabric flowers. Today, M&S Schmalberg is the last of its kind in America, surviving as a domestic factory in a world dominated by imported goods. The company has evolved to focus on specialty custom fabric flower projects for couture fashion designers, milliners, and costume designers.",

    "description": "Located atop the Friend Seminary's 16th Street campus, James Turrell's Leading (2023) is a meeting room in the skyâ€”a spiritual space for silence and contemplation and a physical manifestation of the K-12 Quaker school's mission. One of more than eighty-five Skyspacesâ€”but the only one attached to a K-12 schoolâ€”Leading is a specifically proportioned chamber where viewers have a unique and personal experience of the sky through a knife-edged aperture in the roof. A softly lit interior combined with the changing light of the sky above provides a dramatic experience for the viewer. Benches line the perimeter of the enclosed space, and LED lights, which surround the aperture inside and outside the chamber, shift colors to affect the viewer's perception of the sky. Based on the science of how humans perceive light, the individual experience is the actual work itself.",
