A softly lit interior combined with the changing light of the sky above provides a dramatic experience for the viewer. Benches line the perimeter of the enclosed space, and LED lights, which surround the aperture inside and outside the chamber, shift colors to affect the viewer's perception of the sky. Based on the science of how humans perceive light, the individual experience is the actual work itself.",
