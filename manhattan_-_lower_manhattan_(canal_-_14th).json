Part of Courr\u00e8ges\u2019s ascent is down to its artistic director\u2019s penchant for putting on rave-like dance parties. Last night\u2019s was at Nowadays in Brooklyn with br0nz3_g0dd3ss, Sene, Big Gay Idiot, and Bearcat on the deejay tables.<br><br>WATCH<br><br><br>A Glimpse Inside John Galliano\u2019s Treasure-Filled Hideaway in Northern France<br><br>Alexander Wang and the Danish import Ganni are on opposite corners, and like his new neighbors, Di Felice makes a point of keeping prices on the accessible side of luxury. \u201cYou know, back in the day, Andr\u00e9 was speaking to the young generation. I knew from my first week that it was part of the house,\u201d he told Vogue Runway\u2019s Sarah Mower at his men\u2019s presentation in June. \u201cSo I really want young people to be able to afford the clothes; to make it, let\u2019s say, more accessible.\u201d There\u2019s equally as much menswear on display in the new boutique, including a vinyl trucker jacket. \u201cI was scared of the shiny aspect, \u201c Di Felice said, \u201cbut they really go for it.\u201d Yes, the Courr\u00e8ges hot streak seems likely to continue.",

    "description": "This 220-year-old house is a reminder of New York City's Dutch past.<br>THE STUYVESANTS WERE THE FOUNDING family of New Amsterdam, so it follows that their 220-year-old house on a street named after them in the Bowery (which derives its name from the Old Dutch word for \u201cfarm\u201d) still stands today. <br><br>At No. 44 Stuyvesant stands a stately Federal-style house built for Nicholas William Stuyvesant, descendant of New Netherlands\u2019 first governor Peter Stuyvesant. It doesn\u2019t jump out from the surrounding buildings but those in the know will spot the building\u2019s age and import.<br><br>The house is crawling with stylistic signs of its era, including splayed lintels, Flemish Bond brickwork, and doorway proportions that are typical of that era. It was built in the same year that Nicholas Stuyvesant married Catherine Livingston Reade. The society couple lived there until 1818, but the house stayed in the Stuyvesant family for generations. In 1811, when the city laid out the grid system plan of streets for the quickly expanding city, diagonal Stuyvesant Street survived the restructuring, likely because of the family\u2019s and street\u2019s historical significance.<br><br>In 1969, the house was designated a landmark as part of the St. Mark\u2019s Historic District. At this time it was one of the oldest houses to be used continuously as a residence in Manhattan. It rivals the Jumel Mansion and the Dyckman farmhouse as one of the oldest homes in the city, but it is certainly the furthest downtown.",

Inside its bright, buttercream interior, an immense assortment of old prints and maps line every wall and fill neatly-labeled display racks.<br><br>This sanctuary of beautiful historical pieces was created by Sidney Solomon and Henry Chafetz in 1946. It was originally one of the many second-hand book stores on Fourth Avenue, an area that was then known as \u201cBook Row.\u201d Now under the leadership of Sidney\u2019s daughters, Shirley and Rebecca, Pageant Print Shop primarily sells old prints and is thriving at its current 4th Street location.<br><br>Having worked with historic pieces her whole life, Shirley knows how to get the best prints. She has amassed her impressive collection from antique book auctions as well as other various sources that she has built up over the years. Rodger, who has been working at Pageant Print Shop for over a decade, told Manhattan Sideways that \u201cwhat we are looking for are old books with the bindings broken that are really not in very good shape on the outside, but still have good quality prints, maps, or illustrations on the inside.\u201d Although they search for old books based on the contents within, the shop also sells the old bindings for creatives looking to make decoupage and other fun art projects.<br><br>Pageant Print Shop is definitely a fixture in the East Village, and in the words of Rodger, is \u201cone of those neighborhood jams.\u201d They enjoy \u201ca loyal group of people that have been coming here for eons,\" tourists looking for something authentically New York City, and neighborhood people walking by. Rodger told us that newcomers are often \u201csurprised that they are able to buy a piece of history,\u201d and return for more of their authentic, beautiful, and historic prints. Pageant Print Shop is unique in its extensive, high quality, and affordable selection. Rodger affirmed that \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard for you to find someone who has this kind of a collection at these kinds of prices - it\u2019s just true.\u201d",
