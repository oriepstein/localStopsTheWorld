All that and more is ready to be experienced at this museum dedicated to educating the public about the history of electronic communications and the state's contributions. Proceeding chronologically from the 1850s through the 1970s, the museum chronicles the rise of radio and evolution of communications through a collection of radios, typewriters and industrial equipment, phonographs, televisions, TV studio equipment, telephones, recording studio equipment, and even the first computers. Also explore the rivalries between communications pioneers Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell and, later, Edison and George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla, by trying out Edison's early lightbulb designs and a miniature version of Tesla's renowned coil.",

But the Old State House, which was Connecticut's original seat of government from 1796 to 1878, is once again open to the public. Stroll through the chambers of the House of Representatives and the Senate, where the Amistad trial began and the 13th Amendment was ratified, and spy an original portrait of George Washington. Resist the urge to take a spin on Mark Twain's bicycle. Things get a little wacky when you venture upstairs into the Museum of Natural and Other Curiosities, where the walls are lined with rare masks, animal heads and bizarre items such as a 'unicorn's horn' and a two-headed calf.\"",

As a result, people under age 18 are not permitted on the site, and all visitors must stop by a security building at 550 Main St. around the corner from the museum, for a quick safety briefing before being allowed access (don't worry, it's safe!). Once they get \"clearance,\" guests are rewarded with an engrossing immersion in Connecticut's rich aerospace history: Igor Sikorsky developed the helicopter across the street, Charles Lindbergh kept his plane nearby for a time, a line of flying saucer-like planes were briefly planned in Stratford. And, of course, Gustave Whitehead — at least according to any aviation historians in Connecticut worth their salt — beat the Wright brothers to the air. This history comes alive thanks to the showstopping restorations of many historic aircraft featured at the center. Last May, the center held a groundbreaking ceremony for the first phase of restoration on the historic Curtiss Hangar, across the street from the center.\"",

The three judges hid out on the top of West Rock in what is now called Judges Cave, a rock formation situated along the south end of Regicides Trail, a 7-mile, blue-blazed hiking trail.

To access the fairy village, find Old Waterbury Road. At the end of this road is an old access road that is now more of an overgrown trail. You cannot drive down the access road, and there are signs saying you cannot park on Old Waterbury Road or risk being towed. They don't want people parking there to walk to the village.<br><br>While not restricted or illegal, the town doesn't make it easy to access the area because they are worried about vandalism and misuse. You will need to walk along the service road until you see giant power lines and the highway in front of you. Once you pass under the giant power lines keep to the left going into the woods down a well-walked trail. Depending on the time of year the path is usually pretty visible. Go towards the crumbling main large human-sized hut. On the other side, you will find the cliff throne and some of the best-preserved fairy houses. There are several houses in various states of crumbling ruin scattered throughout the forest, but be careful if you stray from the trails; there is a lot of poison ivy.",
