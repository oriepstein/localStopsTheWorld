But the Old State House, which was Connecticut\u2019s original seat of government from 1796 to 1878, is once again open to the public. Stroll through the chambers of the House of Representatives and the Senate, where the Amistad trial began and the 13th Amendment was ratified, and spy an original portrait of George Washington. Resist the urge to take a spin on Mark Twain\u2019s bicycle. Things get a little wacky when you venture upstairs into the Museum of Natural and Other Curiosities, where the walls are lined with rare masks, animal heads and bizarre items such as a \u201cunicorn\u2019s horn\u201d and a two-headed calf.\"",

    "description": "The cave where two British judges hid in exile after sentencing the king to death.\u00a0<br>\"New Haveners will recognize the names Whalley, Dixwell and Goffe for three major roadways in the city. What Elm City residents and others in the state might not know is the incredible story behind the three names, a story that connects New Haven to what, at the time, were earth-shaking political developments. In 1649, during the English Civil War, some 59 British judges signed a writ of execution for Charles I (\u201cregicide\u201d), and three of them \u2014 Edward Whalley, John Dixwell and William Goffe \u2014 fled for the colonies. The three judges hid out on the top of West Rock in what is now called Judges Cave, a rock formation situated along the south end of Regicides Trail, a 7-mile, blue-blazed hiking trail. The cave is still there, with a plaque that tells the story with the quote: \u201cOpposition to tyrants is obedience to God.\u201d\"",

They don\u2019t want people parking there to walk to the village.<br><br>While not restricted or illegal, the town doesn\u2019t make it easy to access the area because they are worried about vandalism and misuse. You will need to walk along the service road until you see giant power lines and the highway in front of you. Once you pass under the giant power lines keep to the left going into the woods down a well-walked trail. Depending on the time of year the path is usually pretty visible. Go towards the crumbling main large human-sized hut. On the other side, you will find the cliff throne and some of the best-preserved fairy houses. There are several houses in various states of crumbling ruin scattered throughout the forest, but be careful if you stray from the trails; there is a lot of poison ivy.",
