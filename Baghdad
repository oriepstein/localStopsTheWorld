Each contained copper and iron, and was sealed with asphalt. It was hypothesized based on the various components, that they were a type of battery, possibly used to electroplate metals. Since they were noticed long after they had been taken from outside of their archeological context, not much else is known about them.",

The cafe even had a library. Many a discussion has taken place here over the last 100 years — of politics, culture, philosophy, trade, literature, poetry, art… oh, to be a fly on the wall through the ages! But Shabandar is also a place with scars. In 2007, during the US war, a car bomb on Al-Mutanabbi Street destroyed the cafe and library, killing more than 100 people, including four of the owners sons and one grandson. Their mother died months later, as a result of the shock. The owner, Muhammad al-Khashali, vowed to keep going, to preserve the cafes old identity, and he has succeeded. Its a wonderfully atmospheric place to sit with a glass of tea, people watching.",
