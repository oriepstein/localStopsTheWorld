First came the Dua Lipa and Bella Hadid sightings. Then the Instagram takeover—fashion types of all stripes posting selfies and street style pics of themselves in the vinyl Reedition jacket Di Felice modeled after André Courrèges’s 1971 original, or the vinyl mini, or the vinyl over-the-knee boots—sometimes all three at once. Now, there’s a new corner boutique at 104 Grand Street in Soho, the brand’s first in the US since the founder’s days.<br><br>Vogue Club logo <br> ACCESS. COMMUNITY. EVENTS. MEMBERS GET MORE <br> JOIN THE CLUB<br>With three weeks to go until his fourth Paris runway show for the label Di Felice was in New York yesterday to show off the new space. A riff on its Rue François Premiere flagship, it’s all white walls and fixtures and gleaming mirrored surfaces, the better to show off the rainbow of Reedition vinyl pieces on the racks—don’t let these pictures fool you, the store is popping off with color. Designed by the Belgian architect Bernard Dubois, a classmate of Di Felice’s at La Cambre in Brussels, it makes ample use of Courrèges’s geometries: A circular console at the center of the square room is echoed by the circular rack that displays the clothes, and the entirely mirrored dressing rooms provide reflections from all angles. “Bernard has a radicality and an idea of minimalism that I love,” Di Felice says of the architect. The store’s press release points out the “club grade spotlights” on the ceiling. Part of Courrèges’s ascent is down to its artistic director’s penchant for putting on rave-like dance parties.

I knew from my first week that it was part of the house,” he told Vogue Runway’s Sarah Mower at his men’s presentation in June. “So I really want young people to be able to afford the clothes; to make it, let’s say, more accessible.” There’s equally as much menswear on display in the new boutique, including a vinyl trucker jacket. “I was scared of the shiny aspect, “ Di Felice said, “but they really go for it.” Yes, the Courrèges hot streak seems likely to continue.",

Even though its typical wares — which Zoe Report fashion editor Aemilia Madden tells us range from bright velvet chairs ($550) to crazy glass straws ($28) to a giant marbled-concrete bowl ($850) — aren’t serious per se, bookstore owner Leigh Altshuler says they’re all still adult (and that her customers keep trying to buy the water carafe she once bought there out from under her nose). And Todd Heim, who goes by the drag name Steak Diane, tells us that its recent move to the corner of Orchard and Canal, incrementally closer to Dimes Square, “has made it a true ‘clubhouse for the neighborhood.’ ” Speaking of its new location: It’s slightly larger, meaning room for more of the vintage furniture, like a Milo Baughman love seat ($3,500) and a ’70s Italian marble coffee table ($3,200) that it also sells in its fifth-floor showroom around the corner on Allen Street.",

In 1811, when the city laid out the grid system plan of streets for the quickly expanding city, diagonal Stuyvesant Street survived the restructuring, likely because of the family’s and street’s historical significance.<br><br>In 1969, the house was designated a landmark as part of the St. Mark’s Historic District.

Rodger told us that newcomers are often “surprised that they are able to buy a piece of history,” and return for more of their authentic, beautiful, and historic prints.

At the new Starr, audiences will enjoy an expanded venue with improved access and comfort, while artists will benefit from larger, functional spaces on-site that support all the ways they work.<br><br>The new lobby brings the Starr’s mission to the streets of Brooklyn by welcoming passersby to freely enter throughout the day to an accessible space of community gathering. This space offers a new model for what a lobby space can be: a classroom, screening room, lively gathering space, quiet meeting space—a place where people always feel welcome to meet, mix, connect, and get inspired. Building tours with The Bushwick Starr Co-Founders, Noel Allain and Sue Kessler will be offered on a rolling basis.",

The wheel or rose window was given by the children of the Sunday school at the time of the rebuilding in 1890. It is 28 feet in diameter and is one of the larger windows of this type in Brooklyn. In 1981 the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Church of St. Luke and St. Matthew as a landmark.<br><br>Funded through a NYCDEP Green Infrastructure Grant, the new green infrastructure network for the Church captures, stores, and recycles on-site stormwater to protect the foundation of the historic building from flooding, while sustaining new public gardens and walkways.\"",

The Niblo Mausoleum is undoubtedly one of the prettiest sights at Green-Wood. But the Niblo Mausoleum was once host to one of the most scandalous parties in Brooklyn.<br><br>William Niblo was a theater impresario, the owner of Niblo’s Garden, a “pleasure theater” that opened in 1828 at the corner of Broadway and Prince Street in Manhattan. The Garden would feature dancers, fireworks, music, and more. As a prominent New Yorker, Niblo purchased and built his mausoleum at Green-Wood well before his earthly demise in 1878. Recognizing its potential as an event space, he would throw wild parties on the lawn of the mausoleum, much to the chagrin of the cemetery management at the time. Today, Green-Wood has embraced Niblo’s legacy and thrown their own parties inspired by Niblo’s Garden.",

      "description": "It’s hard to miss the Van Ness Parsons mausoleum at Green-Wood Cemetery because the mausoleum is a legitimate pyramid. Though the Egyptian influence was a big part of Art Deco design in the early 1900s, the Van Ness Parsons mausoleum is a fascinating hybrid of Egyptian Revival and Christian symbolism. Greeting you at the front of the pyramid, you’ll see Jesus Christ, holding a lamb, and the Virgin Mary, holding the infant version of Jesus just next to him. There’s another female figure to the left, probably Pharaoh’s wife discovering baby Moses. But just adjacent to Mary is a friendly sphinx, and there are Egyptian vulture wings that adorn the mausoleum’s doorframe. It’s a beautifully bizarre convergence of cultures.<br><br>The mausoleum belongs to Alfred Ross Parsons, a celebrated pianist and music teacher who died in 1933. Parsons was also an Egyptologist and author of New Light from the Great Pyramid, on the geographical discoveries of the Egyptians. So it’s unsurprising that Parsons rests in a literal pyramid, alongside his wife, Alice Schuyler Van Ness, who predeceased him in 1931.",

      "description": "Debutante Charlotte Canda was coming home from her “coming out” party on the evening of her seventeenth birthday in 1845 when the horse pulling her carriage down Fifth Avenue was spooked by a thunderclap. Charlotte was thrown from the carriage and died in her father’s arms. She had been hard at work on designs for the tomb of her aunt, who had recently died. Those designs went into her own grave as Charlotte’s grieving father immediately began plans for an elaborate memorial to his daughter at Green-Wood.<br><br>The resulting tomb became one of Green-Wood’s most popular tourist attractions once it was completed in 1848. By the 1860s, people knew “Miss Canda” from poems and songs about her grave at Green-Wood. The gorgeous, Gothic style memorial is filled with symbolism: it is seventeen feet wide and seventeen feet long, for each year of Charlotte’s brief life. A statue of Charlotte stands underneath a canopy of stars, decorated with roses, which symbolize the loss of a young woman. Charlotte’s fiance, a young man named Charles Albert Jarrett de la Marie, consumed with grief, committed suicide a year after her death. At the time, suicides weren’t allowed to be buried in consecrated ground, so he rests just adjacent to Charlotte’s epic memorial at Green-Wood.",

Central to this plan was the construction of a Park Pavilion and Maintenance Facility, designed by 1100 Architect. The concept was developed based on the requirement that five distinct programs (athletic storage, public restroom, staff office, work area, and vehicle storage) be located within one site.<br><br>One of the design challenges was to build a single facility that worked both as a hospitable environment for park visitors, but also as a durable facility for the heavy use of park vehicles and maintenance equipment. To cohesively serve those two very different user groups, the design creates an innovative footprint that merges three connected wings. The building doubles as a gateway to the park, providing a sense of arrival. On track for LEED Silver Certification, the design also includes an array of measures for sustainability and energy efficiency.",

The most striking (and contentious) monument is the Nation’s Heroes Memorial and Mausoleum.<br><br>Built in the 1960s to honor socialist militants and as a place of burial for leaders, the monument took on new meaning after the fall of Communism in Romania. Renamed the Nation’s Heroes Memorial, the mausoleum now hosts the remains of Romanian soldiers and a flame burns for the Unknown Soldier. Unfortunately, it is impossible to get close to the monument or visit the mausoleum; it’s guarded and entering any area of the memorial is strictly prohibited.",

Sikorsky Memorial Airport, the Connecticut Air & Space Center has the feel of a top-secret site. The property is owned by the federal government. As a result, people under age 18 are not permitted on the site, and all visitors must stop by a security building at 550 Main St. around the corner from the museum, for a quick safety briefing before being allowed access (don’t worry, it’s safe!). Once they get “clearance,” guests are rewarded with an engrossing immersion in Connecticut’s rich aerospace history: Igor Sikorsky developed the helicopter across the street, Charles Lindbergh kept his plane nearby for a time, a line of flying saucer-like planes were briefly planned in Stratford. And, of course, Gustave Whitehead — at least according to any aviation historians in Connecticut worth their salt — beat the Wright brothers to the air. This history comes alive thanks to the showstopping restorations of many historic aircraft featured at the center. Last May, the center held a groundbreaking ceremony for the first phase of restoration on the historic Curtiss Hangar, across the street from the center.\"",

In 1649, during the English Civil War, some 59 British judges signed a writ of execution for Charles I (“regicide”), and three of them — Edward Whalley, John Dixwell and William Goffe — fled for the colonies. The three judges hid out on the top of West Rock in what is now called Judges Cave, a rock formation situated along the south end of Regicides Trail, a 7-mile, blue-blazed hiking trail.

In 1781, Arnold, an American general who famously switched to the British side, led a raid on New London and Groton that resulted in the massacre of more than 80 troops at this fort across the Thames River in Groton. There is a memorial to these fallen soldiers, and guests can wander at will through the remains of the structure, which is among the best examples of a Revolutionary War fort still in existence. The Ebenezer Avery House, which sheltered the wounded after the battle, is also on the grounds. The site is part of the Thames River Heritage Park, which connects the fort with City Pier in New London and Fort Trumbull across the river by means of a water ferry running seasonally Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\"",

Rather than maximizing rentable floor area, we placed the office floors atop an elevated, horizontal base and set them perpendicular to Park Avenue. This design established a light and airy plaza and introduced a new relationship between the office and public realm.<br><br>Since then, the landmark has been under the care of SOM for more than 70 years, a level of stewardship that is rare in the architectural profession. SOM restored its facade in 2001, and returned again in 2023 to complete the building’s restoration for the 21st century. Join Principal Frank Mahan of a tour of the completely updated plaza and outdoor spaces, a lovingly restored lobby, and new mechanical systems that improve energy efficiency; and witness how the project has recaptured this midcentury icon’s original splendor as Park Avenue’s premier boutique office.",
