    "description": "MOST VISITORS TO BOWLING GREEN today come to see Arturo Di Modica\u2019s imposing Charging Bull sculpture. But unnoticed in the background of their photographs is one of New York Cities most enduring and historically important landmarks: its oldest fence.<br><br>Made of wrought iron, the historic barrier was installed around Bowling Green in 1771. The history of Bowling Green itself goes back to the beginnings of the New Amsterdam colony. Situated across from the original Dutch fort it was originally used as a cattle market and parade ground, it was located at the foot of the old American Indian path which would eventually become Broadway. On March 12th, 1733 the market place was leased to three gentleman landowners for a sum of one peppercorn a year, and the ground was turned into New York\u2019s first public park. Named Bowling Green for the sporting arena that it contained, it was designed for the \u201cbeauty and ornament\u2026as well as for the Recreation and Delight of the inhabitants of this city.\u201d<br><br>But the idyllic tranquility of Bowling Green would turn to mob violence in 1776. Six years earlier the British government had installed a giant statue of King George III. Weighing over 4,000 pounds it was built to celebrate the victory over the French in the Seven Years War. As relations between Britain and her colonies steadily deteriorated the statue became a focal point for anti-English protests. To combat the increasing threat of vandalism a wrought iron fence was installed to protect the monarch in 1771. On July 9th, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read out to Washington\u2019s troops stationed by City Hall. A mob from the Sons of Liberty rushed to Bowling Green and immediately attacked and toppled the statue of George III. Legend has it that the statue was shipped up to a foundry in Connecticut where the likeness of George III was turned into musket balls to be used against his red-coated army. Partial remains of the statue can still be found in the Museum of the City of New York.<br><br>Today Bowling Green still holds its place in history as the first public park in the City. Where once King George III looked up towards Broadway as his subjects played the gentle game of Crown Bowls in the park, there is now a fountain. Surrounded by the imposing buildings of the Alexander Hamilton customs house, the old Standard Oil headquarters and the shipping offices of Cunard and the Panama-Pacific Ocean liners, it\u2019s a popular spot for tourists. New York\u2019s oldest fence which once protected a king is still there though, and on closer inspection still bears the scars of that day of violence in 1776. See the fence posts were once decorated with royal crowns but on July 9th, the Sons of Liberty cut them off and the saw marks are still visible today.",

    "description": "NOW AN ANONYMOUS CONDOMINIUM, THE building stands on a site of one of the financial building blocks of New York City, and one of its greatest shames: the sale and trade of enslaved people. <br><br>In 1626, 11 captives from Congo, Angola, and the island of Sao Tome were brought to New Amsterdam. Over the next 150 years, the New York slave trade grew to be one of the most essential cogs in the triangle trade. Seventy-four Wall Street, on the lot bounded by Water and Pearl Streets, is the most widely accepted address of this auction block.<br><br>The first enslaved workers who were brought to the site were tasked with constructing defenses for the small Dutch colony in the form of a wall across the town\u2019s northern frontier. Years later, the wall would be taken down and its fragments used to level the roads and expand the island as landfill. All of the requisite labor was done by enslaved people.<br><br>At the start of the 18th century, the corner of Wall and Pearl Street was an open-air market, where enslaved people were unloaded from ships in the nearby East River. At that time, the river was much closer at Water Street, which meant that the enslaved people were bought and sold right under the shadow of their floating prisons. Later development brought a sheltered complex, city oversight and, of course, tax revenue. Enslaved people were sold throughout the city and its surrounding region. In a wider scope, New York positioned itself as the port city where agricultural goods grown by slaves in the South were financed, refined, packaged and shipped around the world. The New York Stock Exchange, just up the street, owes its startup capital to an economy fueled by enslaved people and their labor.<br><br>Today, no evidence remains of the New York Slave Market. In June of 2015, the City of New York unveiled a small plaque in the beer garden adjacent to the modern day 74 Wall Street. <br><br>The small plaque memorializing the many thousands of enslaved people who were abducted and sold on what is now 74 Wall Street is roughly the size of a plaque across the street at 74 Wall Street honoring the Livingston family, who owed their political prominence to the wealth they generated from the slave trade. <br><br>The United States currently has no significant national memorial to slavery.",

The tavern was also one of the first buildings to be designated a New York City Landmark in 1965, though much of the original colonial structure is non-existent. There has been a structure located at the site since 1719 when it was originally built as a private residence for Etienne DeLancey. In 1761 Samuel Fraunces, from whom the building takes its name, bought the building and opened the Queens Head Tavern. The tavern played a significant role in the American Revolution, serving as a meeting place for revolutionary groups like the Sons of Liberty and as a residence for George Washington during the final days of the war. However, after a restoration in 1906, much of the original structure was lost or obscured and there was a lot of guesswork in recreating the original structure. There are however some pieces of the original structure that survive.

Then Edison joined a banquet for 900 other prominent guests that the New-York Tribune called \u201cthe highest dinner ever held in New York.\u201d During the ceremonies, famed radio pastor Samuel Parkes Cadman made \u201ccathedral of commerce\u201d the skyscraper\u2019s nickname for the ages.<br><br>Over 100 years later, much of the original glory remains, though the general public wouldn\u2019t know it. Master architect Cass Gilbert\u2019s Gothic gem still gleams in lower Manhattan, but few tourists have been inside in recent years. The building\u2019s owners for the past couple of decades closed it to casual visitors. Post-9/11 security restrictions didn\u2019t help, either. But that\u2019s starting to change.<br><br>Thanks to the efforts of Gilbert\u2019s great-granddaughter, Helen Post-Curry, the owners allowed private tours in 2013 for the building\u2019s centennial celebration. A great response led to regular paid tours. The tours focus almost entirely on the lobby\u2014in addition to the aforementioned unfortunate closures, the 57th-floor observation deck was shut down during World War II out of fear that enemy spies could exploit its harbor views\u2014but the lobby contains plenty to illuminate the Woolworth\u2019s soaring story.<br><br>One need only look up at the grand Heinigke & Bowen stained-glass ceiling over the main stairs to grasp F.W. Woolworth\u2019s animating vision. Border panels devoted to great empire-builders like Spain and Russia lie alongside others featuring the Woolworth \u201cW\u201d as well as 1913 for the building opening and 1879 for the opening of the first successful \u201cWoolworth\u2019s Great Five Cent Store\u201d in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (a store in Utica, New York, failed in 1878, and Woolworth reused its sign in Lancaster).<br><br>By 1910, the operation was humming along well enough for Woolworth to lay plans for a company headquarters that would be the tallest building in the world, surpassing the 700-foot Metropolitan Life Insurance skyscraper completed in 1909. Woolworth scrapped a more modest $5 million estimate, and the final bill of $13.5 million produced the 792-foot (and one inch) finished structure of 58 stories (or 80 conventional stories, since ceilings range from 11 to 20 feet). The retail baron paid for it all in cash\u2014perhaps in nickels and dimes only, as some say, and perhaps not.<br><br>It\u2019s also said that Woolworth spared no expense on the construction. Yet despite the gaudy price tag, he couldn\u2019t resist a bit of skimping (amusingly enough, Woolworth is counting coins in the lobby gargoyle that portrays him). The Tiffany elevator ornamentation is cast iron done up like brass, terra cotta masquerades as marble on the exterior, and interior marble touted as \u201cGreek\u201d was actually mined in Vermont. Woolworth hired Cass Gilbert to create a world-class, historic company monument, but he always had business in mind.<br><br>\u201cMy idea was purely commercial,\u201d he said in 1910. \u201cI saw possibilities of making this the greatest income producing property in which I could invest my money.\u201d<br><br>The building\u2019s construction was a media phenomenon, and Woolworth was surely pleased with its critical reception and popularity. Woolworth opened his crown jewel up just like his stores, with counters and eateries alongside plentiful retail outlets. Missteps were minimal, such as the German beer hall shunned by some patriots during World War I, though the war\u2019s drain on construction did benefit the building overall\u2014it remained the world\u2019s tallest until 1930, when the Chrysler Building and then the Empire State Building were completed.<br><br>The Woolworth Building finally left Woolworth hands in 1998 with a $155 million sale to the Witkoff Group, which launched a plan to turn the top 25 floors of the bui",

    "description": "An odd, ancient window that may have once been part of a brutal prison is embedded in the side of New York's Police Plaza. <br>HIDDEN AWAY ON A WALL of the New York City Police Department Headquarters is a mysterious window. Embedded in the wall, and made of an ancient brick which doesn\u2019t match the ones surrounding it, the window is set with a row of ominous, rusted iron bars. It is thought that this is the remnants of a horrendous prison dating back to the Revolutionary War that stood on the same site. The infamously brutal, Sugar House Prison.<br><br>The plaque underneath the iron-barred window explains that \u201cthis window was originally part of the five-story Sugar House built in 1763 at the corner of Duane and Rose Streets.\u201d During the occupation of New York (1776-1783) by the English, the Sugar House was commandeered by the Redcoats and repurposed as a prison for American prisoners of war, and civilian collaborators. <br><br>As the website Correction History writes, the Sugar House Prison was operated as a place where \u201csanitary conditions were frightful, and starvation was a constant threat, so its evil reputation was well earned, and its death toll unbelievably high.\u201d It is estimated that over 17,500 prisoners died in these conditions, more than twice the number to actually die on the battlefield. <br><br>Sugar houses proved ideal prisons for the British. Another on Liberty Street held around 500 wretched prisoners. An article in the New York Times in 1852 included a first-person account of conditions within the sugar houses by an ex-inmate. \u201cIts appearance was dark and gloomy.....prisoners in an emaciated, starving, wretched condition, their numbers being constantly diminished by sickness and death.\u201d <br><br>There is however some doubt as to the origins of the peculiar window preserved in the wall on Duane Street. As reported in Untapped Cities in 2013, recent research by Professor Edwin G. Burrows at Brooklyn College, claimed that the sugar house on Duane and Rose continued to operate during the occupation.<br><br>What is interesting though is that when the old Sugar House was demolished in 1892, someone had the foresight to preserve a window which undoubtedly looks prison like, and it was incorporated into the wall of the new Rhinelander building. When that too was demolished in 1968 to make way for the present day NYPD headquarters the old window was again preserved in the wall of the brutalist architecture of Police Plaza<br><br>Peculiarly enough, a section of the wall from the ancient sugar house, with an identical window embedded in it, found its way to Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. If the origins of the strange window hidden away on the wall of the NYPD building are debatable, what is beyond doubt is the horrific conditions of the British Sugar House prisons, and the thousands of revolutionaries who died there, many of whom are rumored to haunt the memorial still.",

The centre piece of the MTA\u2019s \u201cGrand Central of Downtown,\u201d which re-opened in November of 2014, was an elaborate \u201coculus\u201d dome of glass and aluminium, spanning 53-feet in diameter, representing what the MTA grandly called \u201ca metaphor for the celestial heaven.\u201d<br><br>As impressive as the giant skylight is, there was quite a remarkable spectacle already in place at Fulton Street Station, hidden away and largely unnoticed at the William Street entrance; the beautiful tile murals that once adorned the walls of the Marine Grill, a grand restaurant located in what was once the world\u2019s largest hotel, the McAlpin.<br><br>The Hotel McAlpin was situated in Herald Square, occupying the corner block of 34th Street and Broadway. Opening in 1912 and soaring 25-stories high, the McAlpin had room enough for 2,500 guests. As well as being, at the time, the world\u2019s largest hotel, it was also one of the most luxurious. The amenities on offer to guests were as breathtaking as they were opulent, including a massive giant Turkish bath and plunge pool that occupied the entire 24th floor. The hotel also had its own in-house orchestra, as well as its own fully equipped hospital. Located on the floor below the Turkish bath, patients benefitted from \u201cevery modern appliance known to surgery.\u201d <br><br>The hotel even had gender specific floors, with newspaper adverts promising that \u201cfor unaccompanied women, the entire sixth floor is reserved.\u201d There was even a separate check-in desk staffed by women, so that single female travelers could avoid the approaches of scoundrels in the main lobby. <br><br>Such was the attention given to customer service that the entire 16th floor was reserved for night workers so they could sleep during the day; the New York Times christened the floor the \u201cSleepy Sixteenth.\u201d<br><br>These heights of luxury extended to the Marine Grill restaurant located in the basement. Dominated by a forest of archways and columns, the grill room was covered in exquisite tile murals designed by Frederick Dana Marsh. The tiles told the story of the maritime history of New York, and featured elaborate murals of steamships, paddle steamers, and ocean liners from the golden age of Trans-Atlantic voyages.<br><br>The 20 murals, fabricated by the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company of Staten Island, spoke to the era when New York was one of the world\u2019s most vibrant, and busiest ports. Covering the entire wall space, they would have looked down on a packed room of patrons dining on lobster and oysters, washed down with Gibson cocktails. <br><br>In the 1970s, the grand McAlpin was sold and converted into 700 apartments, which still exist today, under the name Herald Towers. During renovations, the glorious tile murals were simply thrown away. Susan Tunick, president of the non-profit Friends of Terra Cotta, alerted the New York Landmarks Preservation Committee and the tiles were rescued from the dumpsters outside the old hotel. The tiles were then given to the MTA\u2019s Arts for Transit Program, and they were reassembled piece by piece like a giant jigsaw puzzle over one summer by a group of college interns. In 2000 the restored murals were installed in the Fulton Street Station, along with the ornate iron gate that had adorned the entrance to the Marine Grill. <br><br>New York may have lost one of its grand old hotels, but subway passengers entering Fulton Street Station by the Williams Street entrance can see a little known remnant of its once luxurious opulence.",

The chapel is small, but beautifully maintained and well appointed. Underneath the chapel are recreation rooms used for smaller meetings and Sunday schools. It also houses a quite remarkable museum. The collection includes a still working clock given to Embury and Heck by John Wesley himself in 1768. There is also the original lecturn handmade by Embury and used to preach from in the old rigging loft. Central to Methodism was the idea that close personal fellowship could only be attained by meeting in small groups. Called Class Meetings, the church-goers would sit in a close-knit circle; one of their original distinctive circular set of chairs dating from the 18th century is here as well.<br><br>A quite remarkable find, and one hardly known about or visited, the John Street church still prides itself not just on its long and illustrious history, but on preaching Methodism to its surrounding community today just as it did nearly 250 years ago.",

    "description": "Twice a day one of these tragic bronze mariners drowns with the tide to remember all those the sea has taken.\u00a0<br>HIDDEN AWAY IN THE WATER off Battery Park is one of the most moving memorials you are ever likely to see. The American Merchant Mariner\u2019s memorial, sculpted by Marisol Escobar in 1991, takes the form of three merchant seamen stranded on a sinking ship, terrified, calling for help and trying to reach the desperate hand of one of their shipmates floundering in the water below.<br><br>The United States Merchant Mariner suffered more casualties than any other American service during World War II, 1 of every 26 mariners would not return home. Facing submarines, mines, armed raiders, destroyers, aircraft, \u201ckamikaze,\u201d and the elements. About 8,300 mariners were killed at sea, 12,000 wounded of whom at least 1,100 died from their wounds, and 663 men and women were taken prisoner. Some were blown to death, some incinerated, some drowned, some froze, and some starved. Sixty-six died in prison camps or aboard Japanese ships while being transported to other camps. Thirty-one American merchant ships vanished without a trace to a watery grave.<br><br>The sculpture bears the following inscription: \u201cThis memorial serves as a marker for America\u2019s merchant mariners resting in the unmarked ocean depths.\u201d The monument is based on a true event, the sinking of SS Muskogee by German U-boat 123 on March 22nd, 1942. The Muskogee was sailing from Venezuela to Halifax carrying a cargo of petroleum. Without an escort and unarmed, the Muskogee was hit by a torpedo in her engine room and began to sink within a quarter of an hour, 335 miles north-northeast. Ten survivors clung to life rafts in the burning sea as the U-boat surfaced. The submarine captain Reinhard Hardegen took their photograph, and it\u2019s from this, that Escobar based her sculpture. <br><br>What makes the memorial so moving is that the helpless sailor in the water is covered by the Upper New York Bay with each high tide. His fingertips permanently out of reach to his companions, he drowns twice a day. The plaque next to the memorial makes the striking statue all the more poignant, where we learn that for the crew of the SS Muskogee; \u201cleft to the perils of the sea, the survivors later perished.\u201d",

The amount of destruction totaled $2 million, most of it on the corner of the two streets.<br><br>At the time, the corner building on Wall Street was the headquarters of J.P.

    "description": "On buzzing Wall Street, in what was once the main entrance lobby of a thirty-seven-story skyscraper, Aesop occupies a space of preserved Art-Deco grandeur. Designed with trusted collaborator Jakob Sprenger, the intention was to create something that feels like it might have always been there. Inspiration for this chic retail space came from the bold verticality of Manhattan and the building\u2019s history as the office of the Munson Steamship Line in the 1920s. <br><br>The magnificent pre-existing space was defined by soaring ceilings and walls clad in Fior di Pesco marble. Based on the classical Greek order, pilasters added rhythm to the walls while ornate crown moldings and a coffered ceiling gave the room a strong, opulent character. Developed with Aesop\u2019s in-house team, Sprenger\u2019s concept was to maintain the existing architectural splendor, restore integrity where needed, and to insert a layer of free-standing furniture that could be easily reused in a future location. <br><br>In the depths of the store, a petit chamber in soothing dark hues accommodates more intimate explorations of the brand\u2019s unconventional Eaux de Parfum, leaving the hubbub of Wall Street behind. Each fragrance can be sampled at the horizontal bay, where petri dishes containing fragments of scent-imbued muslin cloth allow one to understand the full body of the aroma.",
